      "THE species and hybrid forms of Epimedium are\n",
      "now widely cultivated, but the names in gardens and\n",
      "garden catalogues are in a state of great confusion.\n",
      "This is partly because there is no available general\n",
      "synopsis in existence to which reference may be\n",
      "made, and I am therefore attempting in this present\n",
      "paper to supply what is required in this direction.\n",
      "There is considerable discrepancy amongst systematic\n",
      "botanists as regards the nomenclature of the rows of\n",
      "floral whorls. The flower has three rows of parts,\n",
      "normally of four members each, placed opposite to\n",
      "one another, outside the stamens. Following Ben-\n",
      "tham and Hooker in Genera Plantarum, I intend in\n",
      "the descriptions which follow to regard the outer row\n",
      "as an outer row of sepals, the second row as an inner\n",
      "row of sepals, and leaves of the third row as petals.\n",
      "Regarding Aceranthus as not worth separating gene-\n",
